    <h2>Career Counselling Session -Al Beruni International School, Harbanspura </h2>

    <p class="intro-text">
      Our team visited Al Beruni International School, Harbanspura, where we conducted an extensive career counselling session designed to guide students in making informed decisions about their future academic and professional paths. The session targeted students of grades 9 and 10, a crucial stage where many begin to explore their interests, strengths, and potential career choices.
        During the session, our volunteers engaged students in an open and interactive discussion about the diverse range of career opportunities available today , from traditional fields such as medicine, engineering, and business to emerging domains like data science, artificial intelligence, digital media, and environmental sciences. We emphasized the importance of self-awareness, helping students understand how identifying their personal interests, values, and aptitudes can play a key role in choosing the right career path.
        To make the session more relatable and inspiring, we invited students and representatives from different universities to share their real-life experiences, academic journeys, and insights into university life. They spoke about the challenges they faced, the decisions that shaped their careers, and how persistence and passion led them to success. This interactive segment allowed school students to ask questions, clarify doubts, and gain first-hand knowledge about higher education options and future career prospects.
        The enthusiasm and curiosity shown by the students were truly remarkable. Many expressed that the session helped them gain clarity about their goals and motivated them to plan ahead with confidence. Our volunteers also provided practical advice on how to select subjects, build strong academic profiles, explore extracurricular interests, and make use of guidance resources effectively.
        Overall, the session was a resounding success, fostering awareness, motivation, and a sense of direction among the young learners. It served as a reminder that early career guidance can empower students to make thoughtful, confident choices and prepare themselves for a brighter, more purposeful future.
