    <h2>Kohrian Plantation Drive – Kohrian Village </h2>

    <p class="intro-text">
     Our team visited Kohrian Village near Barki Road to celebrate Pakistan’s Independence Day (14th August) with a meaningful and sustainable initiative, a large-scale plantation drive dedicated to improving the local environment and promoting green living. As part of our ongoing environmental sustainability efforts, we successfully planted 100 trees, focusing on species well-suited to the local climate and soil conditions.
        The initiative followed the Agroforestry model, an approach that integrates trees within agricultural landscapes. By planting trees along the boundaries of crop fields, we aimed to enhance soil fertility, reduce erosion, and improve biodiversity while ensuring that the crops and the environment benefit simultaneously. This method not only provides shade and wind protection for crops but also contributes to carbon sequestration, helping to reduce pollution and combat the impacts of climate change.
        Throughout the activity, our volunteers worked closely with the local farmers and residents, explaining the importance of tree planting and long-term maintenance. We ensured that each sapling would be well taken care of through scheduled watering and community-based monitoring. The warm hospitality and enthusiasm of the villagers made the event even more special, reflecting a shared sense of purpose and unity.
        We are deeply grateful for the support and participation of everyone involved, from our dedicated volunteers to the local community members. This initiative not only celebrated our nation’s independence but also strengthened our collective commitment to a cleaner, greener, and more sustainable Pakistan. We aim to continue this mission by organizing more such drives and inspiring others to contribute to environmental preservation in their own communities.
